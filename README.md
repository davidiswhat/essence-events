Redesigning essence-events.net

This is a CEN3031 Group Project, created by 4 students.

## Getting started
This project requires nodejs and npm. To setup the project, run
```bash
npm install
```
Then simply run the server with
```
nodejs server.js
```

## Administration

Currently, we create an account with the login credentials `admin`, `password123`. This account is the admin account, and can control other user accounts.

To access the admin dashboard, navigate to `/Admin.html`. (This will later just be turned into a simple redirect.)
